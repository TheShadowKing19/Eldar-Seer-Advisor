### 🚀 Overview

**Eldar Seer Advisor** replaces the standard English advisor with a custom voice pack from Dawn of War II.

This voice pack has been fully updated to be compatible with the latest version of Stellaris and all associated DLCs, including lines for the Galactic Council, Situations, First Contact, and more.

### ✨ Features

* **Complete Replacement:** Replaces the entire default English advisor voice set.
* **Fully Updated:** Includes custom voice lines for all recent game mechanics, ensuring no silent notifications.
* **Unique Personality:** The advisor provides an engimatic tone for your empire, worthy of an ancient, dying race of Warhammer 40k.
* **High-Quality Audio:** All lines have been processed for clarity and consistency.
